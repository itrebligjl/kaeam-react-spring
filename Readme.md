# Business Applications by jBPM - integration with React

This is a demo business application built with https://start.jbpm.org and expanded
to add React frontend.

![React demo](img/reactdemo1.png?raw=true)'

Demo shows how you can use React app frontend for your app which communicates to the REST 
api provided out of the box. It also shows how you can create additional REST endpoints easily
and have the data they provide displayed and updated on via React.

## Getting Started 
1. Clone this repository locally:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/business-applications/sample-react.git
   cd sample-react
   cd sample-react-service
   chmod 755 launch.sh (only needed for unix environments , use launch.bat for windows)
   ```

2. Access your application at localhost:8090

## Techs needed
To run this demo you will need to have Node and NPM installed. The good news is that 
they will be intsalled for you (if not already available) during the build of 
this demo (thanks to frontend-maven-plugin).

## Understanding the demo
1. The sample-react-service module includes the React frontend application (under the reactapp directory)
2. The sample-react-service pom.xml uses the frontend-maven-plugin and maven-antrun-plugin
to build the React frontend app and then bundle it with the generated jbpm business application
jar during the build process.
3. There is no need to start the React frontend app separately from the jbpm business app serice app.
4. When your access your application you can click on the "Start" buttons next to
your process definitions section. After the process is started the process inststances
section updates automatically to display process instances."# sample-react" 
"# kaeam-react-spring"
